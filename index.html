<p> Hi I am 
  <a href="http://www.gqcraft.top/XX/index.html" target="_blank">
    Xiaouxan Han </a>, an artist currently studying at SAIC. Through my works, I express and explore the meaning of life and the world in which we live by using a variety of media. Art, design, media, and technology all play a significant role in my work, and are all interrelated rather than separated. My art is always a reflection of my feelings, my personality, my way of life, and my view of the world. Little things in life often give me inspiration for big thoughts. My work includes: <a href="http://www.gqcraft.top/XX/1.html" target="_blank"> visual images</a>, <a href="http://www.gqcraft.top/XX/2.html" target="_blank">moving images</a>, <a href="http://www.gqcraft.top/XX/3.html" target="_blank">games</a>...and <a href="http://www.gqcraft.top/XX/4.html" target="_blank">so on</a>.
